This project is the second of three capstones and the first without any coding assistance for Springboard's Data Science course.

The aim of the project was to use data of economics, health care, education, and population demographics to produce an expected cancer count for a given territory.
The hope was that public health officials could use the expected value produced in conjunction with either two other models or some error metric to create an alert system.
As the county (or theoretically city) tallied its cancer rates for the year, if the number was significantly above or below what was expected, local government and public health officials would be alerted.
This alert system could then be used to investigate environmental or behavioral hazards in a community as early as possible.
It could also serve as a tool for local activists trying to sound the alarm on a potential threat.

The data was taken from a similar data science challenge but the specific idea and coding are my own.
