This was a project I completed for my Springboard course. The data was provided but the coding is my own.

The task involved analyzing a dataset of riders using a ride-sharing app called Ultimate(like Uber or Lyft).
The goals were:
1. Assess data quality.
2. Formulate an experiment to test whether incentives increased inter city service between two cities.
3. Build a model that predicts user retention after six months of ridership.
